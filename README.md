## Features

- **Automatic Call Rejection**: Automatically rejects incoming calls when enabled
- **Custom SMS Responses**: Sends personalized auto-response messages to missed callers
- **Contact Whitelist**: Allow specific contacts to bypass auto-response
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Set specific time ranges for auto-response to be active
- **Schedule Presets**: Quick setup for Work Hours, Sleep Mode, and Meeting Mode
- **Live Schedule Display**: See current schedule status on main screen
- **Status Bar Indicator**: Persistent red "🔴 OOA" notification when active
- **Professional Settings**: Native Android settings interface with time pickers
- **Simple UI**: Easy-to-use interface for managing settings and messages

## How It Works

1. When a call comes in, the app detects it through the `CallStateReceiver`
2. If auto-response is enabled and conditions are met, it:
   - Automatically rejects the call using `TelecomManager`
   - Sends a predefined SMS message to the caller
3. The app respects whitelist and scheduling settings
4. A persistent **🔴 OOA** indicator appears in the status bar when active

## Required Permissions

The app requires the following permissions to function:

- `READ_PHONE_STATE` - To detect incoming calls
- `ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS` - To automatically reject calls (Android 9+)
- `SEND_SMS` - To send auto-response messages
- `READ_CONTACTS` - To access caller information
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - To maintain settings after device restart
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - To run the call management service

## Important Notes

- **Testing**: The call rejection feature only works on a real device, not in the emulator
- **Android Version**: Requires Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher for call management features
- **Permissions**: The app will not function without the required permissions
- **Battery Optimization**: You may need to disable battery optimization for this app to ensure it works reliably

## Usage Scenarios

## Technical Details

- **Architecture**: Uses Android Services and BroadcastReceivers
- **Call Detection**: Monitors `TelephonyManager.ACTION_PHONE_STATE_CHANGED`

## Troubleshooting

If the app doesn't work as expected:

1. Ensure all permissions are granted
2. Check if battery optimization is disabled for the app
3. Verify that the app is set as the default phone app (if required by your Android version)
4. Check device logs for any error messages
